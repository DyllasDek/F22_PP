dup f x = f x x
dip f x = f (f x x)
twice f x = f (f x)

-- Task 1
dup :: (y -> y -> t) -> y -> t
dip :: (y -> y -> y) -> y -> y -> y
twice :: (y -> y) -> y -> y

-- Task 1.a
{-
####
dip (+) 1 2
####
dip applied to two arguments. Let us fix the type variables 
y1 for this instance (use) of dup. Then, we have the following typings:

dip :: (y1 -> y1 -> y1) -> y1 -> y1 -> y1
(+) :: Int -> Int -> Int
1 :: Int
2 :: Int

Now, we need to match the actual type of each argument of dup with the 
corresponding expected type:
  Int -> Int -> Int = y1 -> y1 -> y1 (from 1st argument)
  Int = y1 (from 2nd argument)
Then we get (+) with two arguments
  Int - > Int -> Int = y2 -> y2 -> y2 (is (+) )
  Int = y2 (from two arguments 
All of these constraints are resolved with y1 = Int and y2 = Int. Then, the type of the entire
expression then matches the type of the return value of dip, which is Int

This task racking my brain, I won't be able to do these without nerves, sorry
I hope i will understand better after getting answers in moodle
